## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nextjs-foodies-app.git
   cd nextjs-foodies-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for Cloudinary in a `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

This app is ready to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (already live!).  
Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and it will handle the rest.

Cloudinary ensures that user-uploaded images remain accessible even after deployments or server resets.

## Feature Improvements

- All user-uploaded images are uploaded to the Cloudinary `foodies_app` folder.
- `saveMeal` function handles temporary local storage, Cloudinary upload, and database insertion seamlessly.
- Cloud-based image storage improves reliability and scalability compared to local `/public` storage.
